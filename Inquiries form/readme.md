This one consists of a small simple form I made to practice how to send data using $_POST[] with php.

I was tasked as well with the elaboration of the corresponding sql database for this form, as well as to depict it using an entity-relationship model diagram.

I apologize to any english speakers that may be reading this doc and checking this project, as I didn't translate the filenames to avoid broken links amongst the files. I hope you understand.

A quick dictionary for those who may concern:
- Incidencias.php = inquiries (the form)
- verificar.php = verification. This is where you get redirected once you fill the form and hit send (enviar), depending on whether you've filled it properly it will show either a completion page or an error page.
- incidencias.sql is obviously, the database.

I may, howerver, translate the text within the pages for convenience in the near future. The text within is simple filler text though, akin to a lorem ipsum sample text. I do not deem it as something extremely important to do frankly, as my priority is to finish this portfolio at this moment.
